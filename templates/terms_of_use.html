        <!-- Introduction and general terms -->
        <p>Welcome to our Encryption Tool. By accessing or using our tool, you agree to be bound by these terms of
            use. Please read them carefully.</p>

        <section>
            <!-- Section on License to Use the Tool -->
            <h2>License to Use</h2>

                strictly in accordance with these terms.</p>

            <!-- Section on Prohibited Uses -->
            <h2>Prohibited Uses</h2>
            <p>You may not use the tool for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. Furthermore, you may not, in the use of
                the tool, violate any laws in your jurisdiction.</p>

            <!-- Section on Intellectual Property -->
            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The tool and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property
                of the Encryption Tool and its licensors.</p>

            <!-- Section on Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability -->
            <h2>Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>The Encryption Tool is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We disclaim all warranties and
                conditions with regard to the tool. In no event shall we be liable for any special, direct, indirect, or
                consequential damages or any damages whatsoever arising out of or in connection with the use of the
                Encryption Tool.</p>

            <!-- Section on Decryption Accuracy -->
            <h2>Decryption Accuracy</h2>
            <p>We do not guarantee that the decryption process will be 100% accurate at all times. Due to the inherent
                complexities and potential variances in encryption algorithms, there may be instances where decrypted
                content may not perfectly match the original plaintext. Users should exercise caution and not rely
                solely on the Encryption Tool for critical decryption needs.</p>

            <h2>Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of your jurisdiction, without
                regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

            <!-- Section on Changes to Terms -->
            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. By continuing
                to access or use our tool after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised
                terms.</p>
